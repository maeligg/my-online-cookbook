Peel 1 onion and chop. Smash 6 garlic cloves with the flat side of your knife. Peel, then finely chop. Peel the ginger with a small spoon, then finely chop.

Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in large Dutch oven over medium. Add onion and cook, stirring often, just until translucent, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring often, until garlic is starting to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Add 5 tsp. curry powder and 0.5 tsp. cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until spices are aromatic and starting to stick to bottom of pot, about 1 minute. Add the coconut milk and stir to loosen spices, then stir in the lentils, the shredded coconut, 2 tsp. salt, and 1 liter of water.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low to keep soup at a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lentils are broken down and soup is thickened, 25–30 minutes.

Meanwhile, coarsely chop the spinach. Add spinach and the tomatoes to pot and stir to combine. Taste and season with more salt. Simmer just to let flavors meld, about 5 minutes. Taste and season again with more salt.

Ladle soup into bowls. Top with yogurt, if desired.
